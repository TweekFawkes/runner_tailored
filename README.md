# Example Tailored Ion Runner
Tailored means that the runner has a custom docker container that is used to run the job with additional software installed.
This ion runner prints out all of the arguments passed to it with addition stdout / stderr outputs for testing. It also prints out all of the environment variables that are available to it.
